This repository demonstrates a common yet dangerous error in HTML: using innerHTML with unsanitized user input. This practice opens the door to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing malicious actors to inject scripts that can compromise the security of the website and its users.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this by using textContent instead of innerHTML, or by using a library such as DOMPurify for more robust sanitization.
